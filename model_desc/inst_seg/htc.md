# Hybrid Task Cascade


simple combination of Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN 不太行


> (1) instead of performing cascaded refinement on these two tasks separately, it interweaves them for a joint multi-stage processing;
> (2) it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can help distinguishing hard foreground from cluttered background
